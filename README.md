# Train Brain

Personal project to run G gauge model trains in my back yard.

## Project Components

The project contains the following components:
- server: nodejs server project with express (port 3001)
- web-ui: next.js browser based UI with material-ui (port 3000)
- on-train: TBD

## Notes

If I want to add text to the SVG layout, I need to mirror it in the component, so it
gets mirrored back the right way by the main transform component.
