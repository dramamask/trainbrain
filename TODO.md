# TODO
- The UI will only show seven pieces, no more. Does this have anything to do with max number of elements in a g?
- Build out the layout. Test to make sure the calculations look good with an extended layout.
- Handle error return from the back-end GEt layout call.
- In the UI, scale the layout accordingly, using the viewbox. The backend should tell us what the world size is.
- Start working on an intersection piece (a cross). We need error calculations to see if it lines up.
