# TODO
- Handle error return from the back-end GET layout call. For example try an unknown piece type in the layout.
  Show the error on the UI.
- In the UI, scale the layout accordingly, using the viewbox. The backend should tell us what the world size is.
- Create API to show the trian position. How do we want to show it on the map (SVG I presume). What info do we need
  from the back-end for that (just coordinates?).
- Start working on an intersection piece (a cross). We need error calculations to see if it lines up.
