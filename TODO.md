# TODO
- Finish the layout calculation on the back-end to work with the pieces that "break the chain".
- Create API to show the trian position. How do we want to show it on the map (SVG I presume). What info do we need
  from the back-end for that (just coordinates?).
- Start working on an intersection piece (a cross). We need error calculations to see if it lines up.
- Use JSON Schema to validate the json piece-defintion and (most importantly) the layout json file.
